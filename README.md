# PLACENET-Project
The system incorporates a machine learning model that evaluates students' readiness for placement by analyzing their educational qualifications, experiences, and internships against a provided dataset.
The project consists of three modules aimed at streamlining the placement process:
Student Preparation Dashboard: Provides students with insights into their preparedness for campus placements based on their resume. Students can assess their readiness and make necessary adjustments to their profiles. They can also update their data at any time using their credentials.
Teacher Monitoring: Enables teachers to monitor student progress and identify individuals based on various parameters, aiding in personalized guidance.
TPO Cell Management: Facilitates the TPO (Training and Placement Officer) cell in accessing and managing all placement-related data efficiently.
